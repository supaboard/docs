# Self-hosting

We don't have an official / easy way to self-host the app yet, but it's already possible.
You'll need to host the core application like a regular Next.js app and bring your own Supabase instance to connect to.

We recommend following the [README](https://github.com/supaboard/app) for more detailed instructions and required environment variables, while we're working on an installer that
will make this process easier.

## Running the app

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm i

# Run the app
npm run dev
```
