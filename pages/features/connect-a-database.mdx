# Connecting a database

Suapaboard allows you to connect different databases and use them for charts on your dashboards. That means each chart can have its own
data source and you can use different databases for different charts.

Currently, we support the following databases and providers:
- Postgres
- Supabase
- _**Soon**: MySQL_

## Adding a new database

To connect a database, you need to go to https://app.supaboard.co/databases.
From there, click on the "Add database" button in the top right corner and follow the instructions.

## Configuring a database

Once you have added a database, you're presented with a two step wizard to configure it.
Firt, choose what kind of database you want to connect to. Currently, we support Postgres and Supabase.

Next, you need to enter the connection details for your database. Depending on the database type, you may need to enter different information here.

## Security

Suapaboard always uses the connection details you provide to connect directly to your database. We never extract or save any data from your database.
Your database credentials are stored encrypted in our database, using the AES-256-CBC algorithm. We decrypt them on the fly and only when we need to connect to your database.
